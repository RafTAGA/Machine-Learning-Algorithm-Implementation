# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Implementation
Example implementation of some ML algorithms. These notebooks aim to help the reader understand the math behind past and modern ML models using personal notes I have taken throughout my academic graduate education. The Goal of this repository is to serve as my portfolio of starting points for dveloping more complex models and answer any technical question that I may have. More models are being added and some will include the latest models or modified aproaches to solve common problems (e.g. YOLO enhancements, K-CNNs, etc). 
Text includes my own interpretation of the topics that needed further detail for better understanding (e.g. Regularization in the Linear Regression Folder's Jupyter Notebook), along with cites from third party works cited with a hyperlink to their work. Feel free to suggest any modifications, corrections or additions you would like to see. The topics covered include:

1. LINEAR REGRESSION
   - Standard Linear Regression
   - Linear Regression with Basic Function Expansion
     - L1, L2 and L1 + L2 Regularization is covered and explained
   - Locally Weighted Regression
2. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
3. COMMING SOON..... KERNELS
